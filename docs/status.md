2. Improve form validation feedback to users
3. Enhance client listing page with filtering and sorting options

### Medium-term

3. Add client history tracking

### Long-term
1. Build reporting and analytics features
2. Implement notification system (email/SMS)
3. Add payment processing integration

## Technical Debt
- Consider refactoring validation approach for more consistency
- Review error handling patterns across controllers
- Evaluate database schema optimization opportunities
